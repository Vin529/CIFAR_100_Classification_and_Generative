This repository contains the code and report for my Deep Learning coursework. This coursework was submitted to the Department of Computer Science at Durham University, and was awarded a mark of 89%.

The task for this project had two parts:
-Develop a classifier with fewer than 100,000 parameters, which achieves the highest accuracy possible on the CIFAR-100 dataset within 10,000 training steps.
-Develop a generative model which produces distinct, realistic images. The model must have fewer than 1,000,000 parameters total, and must be trained for a maximum of 50,000 steps.

We were encouraged to use any sources we could find online, including copying code from existing state-of-the-art models. The extremely small parameter limit made this very difficult.
